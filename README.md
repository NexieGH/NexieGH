- 👋 Hi, I’m @NexieGH, but call me Onnex or Nex!
- 👀 I’m interested in: Data collection, machine learning and computer vision. (I don't know much about ML/CV yet, but I'm on my way to learning!) I LOVE data! I also like drawing and writing for fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Python, JavaScript and C#. Looking to learn R and C++ in the future for more _intense_ projects!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Modding projects for games I play! Right now, I've been learning how to mod **Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2**!
- 📫 How to reach me: Check me out on Discord! Username is **onnex**.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her, but I don't mind otherwise!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was always interested in coding and programming since the age of 11, but I never pursued it in my teens because I thought I wasn't smart enough! Now, I've let go of those beliefs and turns out... it's actually not that hard! You just need persistence and a plan!
